HINT: - Do not attempt part 2 first, you will fail.
    : - When majoring in Cyber Security, Discrete Maths *was* compulsory at my University. We were required to remember key symbols of the Unicode table. The thing I disliked the most was the propositional logic lectures every Thursday at 8.00am because I had to wake up 7.30am to get ready;/ Though I was interested in my Cryptography and Blockchain class which required a great knowledge of maths, one thing I was taught was to never encrypt files/strings with MD5. This is because md5decrypt.net would decrypt most of our hashes in ~0.231s.

Failed Attempts will be IGNORED.
Good Luck!
